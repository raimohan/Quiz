## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark slate blue (#475569) for a professional yet motivational aesthetic.
- Background color: Very light slate gray (#EDF2F7) for a subtle, non-distracting background. The gradient is subtle, transitioning from the light gray to pure white.
- Accent color: Steel blue (#64748B) for interactive elements and highlights. This is similar in hue but has a different brightness and saturation to provide adequate contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Two-column layout with floating cards for quiz content and the question navigator on a subtle gray-to-white gradient background.
- Minimalist icons for navigation (previous, next, review) and to represent the status of each question in the question navigator (answered, current, marked for review).
- Smooth transitions between questions and a visually distinct circular timer animation with color changes (green to red) as time runs out.
